# Data Visualization of riots in India (2016-2022)

### Data

This collection contains over 100,000 recordings and spans the years 2016 to 2022. The information is provided by ACLED (The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project), non-governmental organization that collects and analyzes conflict data.

### Model

The purpose of this research should be to decrease the number of fatalities. Since most of manifestations are legal and the reasons are out of scope for this dataset, the only way in which we could make an impact is by forecasting the number of fatalities in the coming months by region. The results should help to bring more police officers and more mobile medical units in the places that will have a high tendency for fatalities. Also this research should help future turists visiting india to avoid areas with a high risk of injury. For illustration purposes, we have chosen the region with the most fatalities, Jammu and Kashmir, and employed varios methods to forecast a 6 months period.
